In order to be a frontend developer, you need to understand a little bit about
how the web works, and DNS is one of many topics that I think are
essential for a junior developer to know.

So what does actually happen, when you type in your favourite domain, lets say youtube.com ?
From the user perspective, you just click, and the site magically appears in your browser,
that is - if you have internet coinnection of course.

But under the hood, your browser did a lot more than just display you a page.
First - it needs to know where to find this website. And it needs the address that
computers use - the Internet Protocol address, or simply IP address.
The simple answer is this:
Your browser, lets call it Bro asks the Domain NAme System (DNS) of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), lets call him ISP
Bro: Hey ISP, do you know where youtube.com is?
ISP: I dont know bro..

And then ISP asks The main DNS server.
ISP: Hey DNS, do you know where to find youtube.com?
DNS: I know that domains with .com are here (handles IP)

ISP: Hey .com do you know where youtube.com is?
COM: sure dude, it is 208.65.153.238
ISP: K! I will remember it now

ISP: Here you have it Bro!
Bro: Thanks (.... downloading ...)

And this is the moment when your browser downloads the page from the IP address and displays it to you, the happy user.

Im fact, you can also use IP address to directly access the website if you check
 the IP address using the link in the description below and then just type it into your browser!

Thank you for watching,
Im Jurki, have a nice day! -->
